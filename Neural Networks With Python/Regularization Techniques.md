# Regularization Techniques in Neural Networks

Regularization techniques are used in neural networks to prevent overfitting and improve generalization by adding additional constraints or penalties to the model. This document provides an overview of various regularization methods, including their mathematical definitions and properties.

## 1. L1 Regularization (Lasso)

L1 Regularization adds a penalty equal to the absolute value of the magnitude of coefficients to the loss function. This technique can lead to sparse models where some weights become exactly zero.

The regularized loss function is:

$$
L_{\text{reg}} = L_{\text{original}} + \lambda \sum_{i} |w_i|
$$

where:
- $L_{\text{original}}$ is the original loss function,
- $w_i$ represents the weights,
- $\lambda$ is the regularization parameter.

**Properties:**
- Encourages sparsity in the model.
- Can be used for feature selection.

## 2. L2 Regularization (Ridge)

L2 Regularization adds a penalty equal to the square of the magnitude of coefficients to the loss function. This technique discourages large weights but does not drive them to zero.

The regularized loss function is:

$$
L_{\text{reg}} = L_{\text{original}} + \frac{\lambda}{2} \sum_{i} w_i^2
$$

where:
- $L_{\text{original}}$ is the original loss function,
- $w_i$ represents the weights,
- $\lambda$ is the regularization parameter.

**Properties:**
- Penalizes large weights, which helps in reducing overfitting.
- The weights are not zeroed but are made smaller.

## 3. Elastic Net Regularization

Elastic Net Regularization combines both L1 and L2 penalties. It balances the benefits of both regularization techniques.

The regularized loss function is:

$$
L_{\text{reg}} = L_{\text{original}} + \lambda_1 \sum_{i} |w_i| + \frac{\lambda_2}{2} \sum_{i} w_i^2
$$

where:
- $L_{\text{original}}$ is the original loss function,
- $w_i$ represents the weights,
- $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ are the regularization parameters.

**Properties:**
- Combines the advantages of L1 and L2 regularization.
- Can handle correlated features better than L1 regularization alone.

## 4. Dropout

Dropout is a technique where random units (neurons) are "dropped out" during training with a certain probability. This helps to prevent the network from relying too much on any single unit.

The dropout operation can be expressed as:

$$
\tilde{h}_i = 
\begin{cases} 
h_i / p & \text{with probability } p \\
0 & \text{with probability } 1 - p
\end{cases}
$$

where:
- $h_i$ is the output of the neuron before dropout,
- $\tilde{h}_i$ is the output after applying dropout,
- $p$ is the dropout probability.

**Properties:**
- Reduces overfitting by preventing co-adaptation of neurons.
- Requires careful tuning of the dropout probability.

## 5. Batch Normalization

Batch Normalization normalizes the inputs of each layer so that they have zero mean and unit variance. This technique helps to stabilize and accelerate the training process.

The normalization step is:

$$
\hat{x}_i = \frac{x_i - \mu_B}{\sqrt{\sigma_B^2 + \epsilon}}
$$

where:
- $x_i$ is the input to the neuron,
- $\mu_B$ and $\sigma_B^2$ are the mean and variance computed over a mini-batch,
- $\epsilon$ is a small constant to avoid division by zero.

**Properties:**
- Helps in reducing internal covariate shift.
- Can speed up training and improve model stability.

## 6. Early Stopping

Early Stopping involves monitoring the model's performance on a validation set during training and stopping the training process when performance starts to degrade.

The stopping condition is:

$$
\text{Stop training if } \text{Validation Loss} \text{ increases for } k \text{ epochs}
$$

where $k$ is a predefined patience parameter.

**Properties:**
- Prevents overfitting by stopping the training at the right time.
- Requires monitoring and saving the best model during training.

## 7. Data Augmentation

Data Augmentation involves generating additional training samples by applying random transformations to the original training data. This helps to improve model generalization.

Common transformations include:
- Rotation
- Scaling
- Flipping
- Cropping

**Properties:**
- Increases the diversity of the training dataset.
- Helps in preventing overfitting by providing more varied examples.

## 8. Weight Regularization

Weight Regularization involves adding a regularization term to the loss function that penalizes large weights. It is generally implemented through L1 or L2 regularization.

The regularized loss function is:

$$
L_{\text{reg}} = L_{\text{original}} + \lambda \cdot \text{Regularization Term}
$$

where the regularization term could be either $ \sum_{i} |w_i|$ for L1 or $\sum_{i} w_i^2$ for L2.

**Properties:**
- Helps in controlling the complexity of the model.
- Can improve generalization by penalizing large weights.
