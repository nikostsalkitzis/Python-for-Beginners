This repository provides a strong introduction to Python and its data science libraries.

## Notes

1. The `plt.show()` command is not necessary if you work in Jupyter Notebooks or Conda environments.
2. The `matplotlib.use('TkAgg')` setting is only for Linux users who want to see the results in their terminal.
3. For the data analysis part in the master branch, you will need to install the following packages:
    - `numpy`
    - `pandas`
    - `matplotlib`
    - `seaborn`
    - `pillow`
    - `tkinter` (only for Linux)
4. Every `.py` file is split into lessons to better grasp the concepts.

### Installation

You can install the required packages using `pip`:

```sh
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib
pip install seaborn
pip install pillow
pip install tkinter # only for Linux
